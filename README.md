#Draggable Grid Example
This app demonstrates a draggable widget which can be dropped within a grid.

##Cells
This app works on the premise of a GridLayout which is populated with a predefined number of BoxLayouts.  The GridLayout then has a ListProperty of cells, which can be iterated over with the collide point method to find the current position of the touch in the grid

##Draggable Image
The draggable image is heavily based on the draggable image done by Gabriel Pettier, which can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/tshirtman/7282822)
